## Discussion

I started this project simple, by just adding background images and colors to get going. Once the basic components were done, I started working on more important shapes like trees and footprints. I found some difficultly in making the triangular pattern for the trees, but learned how to make triangle without errors.

Some of the colors that I used were white, blue, green, brown, black, and yellow. I tried to use lighter colors that represented the winter ski theme of my greeting card. The colors helped me define certain elements on my page and make it looked finished and complete. 

A very important part that I got better at throughout the project was creating and appending elements in the correct order so that they would show up in the proper layers. The repetition of creating the elements is the main reason that I got better at this component.

One of the new things that I learned in this project was how to get image files from the internet into my project so that I could use them. I found it was easiest to do this by saving the preferred image to my computer with the "save as" command directly into the provided images folder. 

Another new process that I had to learn was the styling, creating, and appending of audio. Luckily, I was able to pick up on it quickly and figure out how to use the .style commands to customize the audio feature. 

After I about half of my elements created and styled, my project was starting to look messy and was very hard to navigate.  At that point I started to add descriptive comments and organize my code more, making it much easier to work on my project. 

When I was first creating my skis I was just going to create two "div" features both with a rounded border to represent the skis on my greeting card. However, once i started styling my first ski, I realized that I wouldn't be to make a very detailed picture of the skis with "div" elements. After a bit of thinking I decided to get an image file of a pair of real Armada skis from the internet, and it ended up turning out pretty good. 

This was a very oped-ended project, so I was able to be pretty creative and make a personalized greeting card that I am happy with. There we a few challenges along the way, but once I figured them out, I was able to figured out the rest of the project pretty smoothly. Overall, I think I learned some important JavaScript aspects and made nice looking project.


## Extra Credit
I think that I should get extra credit because I had 18 different elements and uploaded original photos from the internet to use in my project. I also made my project full screen in order to fit more detail and elements.
